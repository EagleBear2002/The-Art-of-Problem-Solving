\section{Classic Paxos}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Definition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quorum：the Majority is further abstracted, requires an intersection between any two Quorums
        \item Round: each proposal of the proposer is represented by a total ordered number. The execution of this numbered Proposal is called "Round".
        \item i-Quorum: the Quorum needed in Round-i
        \item Classic Round: The Round that performs Classic Paxos
        \item Fast Round: If the leader sends the Any message, the follow-up communication is considered a fast round;
              if the leader does not send the Any message and communicates as before, the follow-up behavior is still Classic Round.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Participation Role}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Client/Proposer/Learner: Responsible for proposals and execute them.
        \item Coordinator: The proposer's coordinator, which can be multiple, and the Client proposes through the Coordinator.
        \item Leader: Elect one of the many Coordinators as the leader.
        \item Acceptor: Responsible for voting on Proposal.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Classic Paxos}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Phase 1a: Leader submits proposal to acceptor
        \item Phase 1b: The acceptor responds with the largest proposer number and the chosen value that has already voted
        \item Phase 2a: The leader collects the return value of the acceptor
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Phase 2a.1: If the acceptor has no return value, then freely decide one
            \item Phase 2a.2: If there is a return value, choose the one with the highest proposal number
        \end{itemize}
        \item Phase 2b: The recipient sends the voting result to the Learner
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Making Paxos Fast}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Algorithm Process}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Phase1a: Leader submits proposal to acceptor
        \item Phase1b: The acceptor responds with the largest proposer number and chosen value that has already voted
        \item Phase2a: The leader collects the return value of the acceptor
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Phase2a.1: If the acceptor has no return value, send an Any message to the acceptor, and then the acceptor waits for the proposer to submit the value
            \item Phase2a.2: If there is a return value, choose one according to the rules
        \end{itemize}
        \item Phase2b: The recipient sends the voting result to the learner (including the leader)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Implementation Considerations}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Collision}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pic/Fast Paxos-2.png}
    MULTIPLE proposers submitting DIFFERENT values to a SINGLE acceptor at the same time is allowed!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{O4(v) Algorithm}
    If $v$ is chosen in Fast Round $k$, then there exists a k-Quorum $R$ such that for any Acceptor $a \in Q \cap R$, $v$ is voted, where $Q$ is a Quorum of a Classic Round.

    Therefore, if the following two conditions are guaranteed:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each Acceptor votes for only one Value in the same Fast Round
        \item $Q \cap R_v \cap R_w \ne \emptyset$
    \end{enumerate}
    Then $v$ and $w$ cannot be selected at the same time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{O4(v) Algorithm}
    According to the above description, in order to prevent a Fast Round from selecting multiple Values, Quorum needs to meet the following two conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any two Classic Quorums intersect
        \item Any Classic Quorum intersects with any two Fast Quorums
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Calculate Quorum}
    Let’s set the total number of Acceptors to be $N$,\\
    the maximum number of failed Acceptors for Classic Round to be $F$,\\
    and the number of allowed failures of Fast Round to be $E$,\\
    that is, N-F constitutes a Quorum of Classic Round, and N-E constitutes a Quorum of Fast Round.\\
    Let $Q_c$ and $Q_f$ be the Quorum sizes of Classic Round and Fast Round, respectively. After sorting, two lower bound results can be obtained:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $N > 2F (N \ge 2F + 1)$
        \item $N > 2E + F (2N \ge 2E + F + 2 ?)$ (Still Confused)
        \item $|Q_c| , |Q_f| \ge N - \left \lceil \frac{N}{3} \right \rceil + 1 \ge \left\lfloor \frac{2N}{3} \right \rfloor + 1$
        \item $|Q_c| \ge N - \left\lceil \frac{N}{2} \right\rceil + 1 = \left\lceil \frac{N}{2} \right\rceil+1$
        \item $|Q_f| \ge N - \left\lceil \frac{N}{4} \right\rceil \ge \left\lceil \frac{3N}{4} \right\rceil$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Collision Recovery}
    Optimization: the Acceptor should also send the value to the Leader when voting, so that the Leader can easily find conflicts. If the leader finds a conflict in Round i, it can easily start Round i+1 and re-execute the Classic Paxos process from Phase1a.
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pic/Fast Paxos-3.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Collision Recovery}
    Further optimized: if the Leader restarts Round i+1 and receives the Phase1b message sent by i-Quorum Acceptors, the message clarifies two things:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Report the maximum Round and corresponding Value that Acceptor a participates in voting
        \item Promise not to vote on Rounds less than i (and less than i+1)
    \end{enumerate}
    If Acceptor a also participates in the voting of Round i, the Phase1b message of a also clarifies the above two things. \\
    ~\\
    Phase2b of Round i has the same meaning as Phase1b of Round i+1 !

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Summary}
    Optimistic locking: find and compensate collisions. The Leader plays a role in initializing the Progress and resolving conflicts. If the Progress has been executed well, the Leader will never participate in the consistency process.\\
    ~\\
    Fast Paxos only needs 2 communication steps in theory, while Classic Paxos needs 3, but Fast Paxos needs at least 1 communication step when resolving conflicts. In high concurrency scenarios, the probability of conflict will be very high, and conflict resolution costs will also be high.\\
    ~\\
    Fast Paxos deeply introduces Client into the algorithm, so that its architecture is far less clear than Classic Paxos, and it is not as easy to extend as Classic Paxos.
